# Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- In this challenge, I create a binary tree and a binary search tree with add and contain methods

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- Followed along with the lecture and test requirement

- The Big O space/time would be Linear O(n)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- [Binary Tree](../../data_structures/binary_tree.py)

- [Binary Search Tree](../../data_structures/binary_search_tree.py)
