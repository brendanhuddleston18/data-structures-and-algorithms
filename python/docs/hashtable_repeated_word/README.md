## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- I first created an instance of a hashtable locally

- I split the user inputted string based on regex, avoiding any spaces and punctuations

- I checked the hashtable to see if the key(word) already existed, if it did return the word

- Set the word into the hashtable
