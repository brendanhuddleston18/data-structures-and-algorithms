# Hashtable
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- In this challenge, I create a Hashtable that sets a key:value pair, get's a value depending on the key you input, checks if the hash has a key, will return all keys and will hash a key and return the index of a key.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- Followed along with the lecture and test requirements.

- The Big O space/time would be Linear O(n)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- [code](../../data_structures/hashtable.py)
