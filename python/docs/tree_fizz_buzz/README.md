# Tree Fizz Buzz
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

- In this challenge, I create a function that takes in a K-ary Tree clones it and modifies it to follow the rules of Fizz Buzz

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- Clone the inputted K-ary tree

- Implement a walk and change function that takes in the root of the clone and checks the divisibility

- Change the value if it adheres to fizz buzz rules

- Return new clone

- The Big O space/time would be exponential O(n)
